# FloraWaveViewer
Code repository for the Flora Wave Viewer project being developed for Hood College Professor Dr. Flora by John Pigott


##Feature and Issue tracking

All planned features can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/ArunawayNERD/FloraWaveViewer/issues) tab and are labled with the "Feature" label. The name of the feature curesponds with the Software Requierments Specifcation for this project.

Any issues not marked with a "feature" are either bugs or some form of future improvment. 

##Running the project
As each milestone is completed, a release will be added to this repository. However, if you want to run the project in its current state, you can find a jar file in the main directory which will be generated before each sync. It should be noted though that this jar file will likly contain unfinished features.
